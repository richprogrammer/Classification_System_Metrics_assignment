# Foundations of Machine Learning Models

## Assignment: Classification System Metrics

#### Name: Richard Lee

## Assignment Details

The purpose of this assignment is to familiarize you with the metrics used to measure prediction performance in classification systems.  Suppose there 20 binary observations whose target values are:

$$[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]$$

Suppose that your machine learning model returns prediction probabilities ([predict_proba()](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.html#sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression.predict_proba) in sklearn) of:

$$[0.886, 0.375, 0.174, 0.817, 0.574, 0.319, 0.812, 0.314, 0.098, 0.741, 0.847, 0.202, 0.31 , 0.073, 0.179, 0.917, 0.64 , 0.388, 0.116, 0.72]$$
